    <h1> Cyber Bullying </h1>
    <h2> What is Cyber Bullying? </h2> 
    <h3 class="CB"> Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place 
       over digital devices like cell phones, computers, 
       and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, 
       Text, and apps, or online in social media, or gaming 
       where people can view, participate in, or share 
       content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, 
       or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content 
       about someone else. It can include sharing 
       personal or private information about someone else 
       causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some 
       cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or 
       criminal behavior.</h3>

   <h2> How we can solve this Problem? </h4>
   <h3 class="CB">Given the “social” nature of social media, perhaps 
       the easiest way to bring a halt to the social 
       acceptance of saying mean things on social media. 
       One way to do that is to get rid of the main
       problem. When people can comment anonymously, 
       they feel empowered to say and do things that they 
       wouldn’t normally do if their social reputation were 
       on the line.But getting rid of anonymity will only go 
       so far. It’s clear that cyberbullying among teens is a 
       problem that’s here to stay as long as we have 
       Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.</h5>
