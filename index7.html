        <h1>About The Developer</h1>
    <h2 class="Me"> Hello, My name is Vaidehi and I am the Developer of the website you are viewing right now. 
        I am 12 years old and I live in Calgary,Canada. In Canada I go to school and go to many fun trips  
        with my family and my friends. I like going camping and to many hikes. Since the Semtember of 2020 I  joined a program called ProGrad Junior,
        in the online class I have learnt how to code. When I entered this program, it was the first time I every coded in my whole life. This was a great expirence of my life. 
        In the first term of this program I made this wedsite called " Stop Bullying ". I like coding but I also have 
        many other things I like to do. Some things I like to do in my spare time are draw, play the Piano, and redecorating
        rooms, I guess you can call these my hobbies. </h2>
