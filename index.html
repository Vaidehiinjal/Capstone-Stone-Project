   <h2>Why we should Stop Bullying?</h2>

 <div class="middle"><h3>Bullying has been an exceeding issue over the 
    years… it is about time to make it stop! Bullying 
    affects everyone not just the victims of bullying but, 
    the bully’s and everyone surrounding them. The numbers 
    of kids that are starting to become victims as well as 
    bullies are increasing. Nobody likes a bully and being 
    one just makes matters worse. Bullying is a major problem 
    that we haven’t been able to stop, every year more and more
    people become bullied at school and online, if we take a stand
    against bullying and not encouraged it I believe that we can 
    put an end to it!</h3></div>
