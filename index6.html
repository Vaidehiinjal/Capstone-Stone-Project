    <h2> What is Social Bullying? </h2>
    <h3 class="SB">The social bullying definition is a form of 
     emotionally aggressive bullying behavior, 
     sometimes referred to as indirect aggression, 
     relational aggression, or covert bullying. It is a form 
     of bullying that can be more difficult to detect 
     because it can occur behind the victimâ€™s back, or it
     can take the form of public humiliation.</h3>

     <h2> Why you should help stop it? </h2>
     <h3 class="SB"> Socail Bullying can occur randomly or regularly. It can happen daily, weekly, or monthly. In fact, one in 10 
         bullying victims are bullied daily, while one in five victims are bullied once or twice a month. The bullied
         student can rarely predict when the bullying will occur, and if the student can predict the bullying, often 
         teachers and staff may not address the incident. In fact, staff may not even catch the first few acts of 
         bullying.Schools need to find ways to reduce this problem. This includes having all teachers, staff, and  
         administrators on board to prevent bullying from occurring. Here are some tips to help you reduce bullying in 
         your school.Bullying occurs at all grade levels. An entire school district needs to have the same language 
         within all its schools in order to reduce bullying. To start, the schools need to have a common definition 
         of bullying. CPI defines bullying as being characterized by intentionally aggressive behavior that 
         involves an imbalance of power and strength. It can be exemplified through physical, verbal/nonverbal, 
         and/or relational means. It is a repeated offense, even when teachers observe it for the first time. 
         Talking to the victim about what happened and whether there have been past occurrences is very important.
         Staff should be able to distinguish between teasing and bullying.Teasing is reported more frequently than
         bullying because teasing is done to irritate or provoke another with persistent distractions or other 
         annoyances. Bullying, on the other hand, is an imbalance of power.This is key. Bullied students are unable 
         to defend themselves, which is what causes the imbalance of power.Bullying occurs in different forms such 
         as threats, teasing, name calling, excluding, preventing others from going where they want or doing what 
         they want, pushing, hitting, and all forms of physical violence.The severity of bullying varies from 
         case to case.</h3>
