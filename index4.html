    <h1> Verbal Bullying </h1>
    <h2>    Verbal bullying is intended to degrade or 
        demean the victim in some way, so the bully feels 
        powerful or strong. It can occur on its own or in 
        conjunction with other forms of bullying. Though it 
        happens more frequently among girls, this type of 
        bullying can happen with boys as well, and it can 
        be just as damaging as (or even more damaging 
        than) physical bullying. A bully might target a 
        specific child because of things like weight, gender, 
        race, appearance or height or for some other reason 
        entirely. If you suspect verbal bullying, please seek 
        help as soon as possible.</h2>

    <h3>The fundamental rule of war is “Know your enemy, and do not play his game–make him play yours.” If you don’t understand the bully’s game, you will lose. If you understand the bully’s game but play it anyway, you will lose. If you understand the bully’s game and do not play it, you will win.</h3>
