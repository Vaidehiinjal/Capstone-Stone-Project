    <h2> What is Emotional Bullying? </h2>
    <h3 class="EB">Emotional bullying is when a person tries to get 
        what they want by making others feel angry or afraid.
        Emotional bullying isn't just seen on the playground; 
        emotional bullying, although likely subtler, is seen 
        in adult relationships and workplaces too.</h3>
        <h2> How to Recognize Emotional Bullying? </h2>
    <h3 class="EB">You probably know many of the more obvious signs of mental and emotional abuse. But when you’re
        in the midst of it, it can be easy to miss the persistent undercurrent of abusive behavior.Psychological 
        abuse involves a person’s attempts to frighten, control, or isolate you. It’s in the abuser’s words and actions, 
        as well as their persistence in these behaviors.The abuser could be your spouse. They could be your business partner, parent, or a caretaker.
        No matter who it is, you don’t deserve it and it’s not your fault.</h3>
